## What is code retreat

[Global Day of Code Retreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/) is an annual event held around the world. It's a day set aside to practice your craft, to hone your skills, all free from the constant pressure to ship that we feel in our day jobs.

Code retreat is for you if:
- You'd like to learn about testing
- You'd like to learn about TDD
- You'd like to learn about code design
- You'd like to teach any of those skills to others outside of a shipping culture
- You'd like to experiment with others in a relaxed setting

## What are we doing today?

We will be working on the [kata][katas] [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in pairs. Ideally, a pair will consist of someone that is able to teach a skill and someone that is interested in learning that skill. We will be working in 30 minute rounds with a short retrospective at the end of each round to share what we did and learned. The problem is __*IMPOSSIBLE*__ to finish in 30 minutes, and that's by design. It allows us to choose on area to approach, and one activity to practice for the round without worrying about completing the problem and shipping a rushed solution. Take your time; talk and learn together!

## How do I get started?

### Setup your environment

If you or your pair are able to _quickly_ setup an environment with a test runner in the language you'd like to work in, then skip to the next step.
If not, there are sample environments in [ruby](), [javascript]() & [python]() for you to use. Follow the instructions in the readme to get started.

### Get started on the problem

With each round, there will be a surprise challenge. You can choose to accept the challenge and work together to solve it. You're not required to, though, so feel free to coordinate with your pair on something that seems fun and valuable to do together.

In the first round, we will be exploring the problem. If you're unsure where to begin, the branch [challenge 0]() will give you a foundation to begin working on the problem.

## Where can I continue learning?

### TDD

### Katas

### Exercism
